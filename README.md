# Category: Kotlin
- Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise

# Overall Experience 
- I learned more than I ever expected.  I felt in the beginning that I would really have a head start being. It would be beneficial to encourage students to find their internship based on their future career goals. It's not always necessary to stick to what's listed or given to us to find the perfect internship. It took me a couple of weeks to really feel comfortable but eventually I learned it was ok and that two heads were better than one.
